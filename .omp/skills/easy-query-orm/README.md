# easy-query-orm

Codex skill for writing, reviewing, and debugging Java/Kotlin code that uses the
easy-query ORM.

This skill is tuned for:

- easy-query setup and proxy generation
- query, CRUD, pagination, and transactions
- row-level locking with `forUpdate()` inside a transaction
- `@Navigate`, `include` / `include2`, and implicit relation queries
- `whereObject`, `orderByObject`, `EasySearch`, and `selectAutoInclude`
- `savable`, native SQL, sharding, and troubleshooting

The references are distilled from easy-query source, tests, and docs, with an
emphasis on verified API names and practical routing.

## Install

Install from GitHub with the `skills` CLI:

```text
npx skills add wzszsw/easy-query-orm
```

If you prefer a manual install, clone or copy this repository into your Codex skills directory:

```text
~/.codex/skills/easy-query-orm
```

Restart Codex after a manual installation so the skill can be discovered cleanly.

## Use

Ask Codex to use the skill explicitly:

```text
Use $easy-query-orm to implement this repository query with verified easy-query APIs.
```

## Structure

```text
SKILL.md
references/
scripts/search_references.py
skillopt/
```

`SKILL.md` is the router. Topic-specific details live in `references/`.

## SkillOpt Assets

`skillopt/` stores local SkillOpt experiment assets for this skill.

The standard path in this repository is the built-in `officeqa` env. The
tracked assets include:

- `configs/officeqa/`: standard SkillOpt configs that target the built-in `officeqa` env
- `configs/_base_/`: shared model and training defaults for the local SkillOpt runs
- `data/officeqa_split/`: short-answer train/val/test items for standard `officeqa` EM/F1 evaluation

Training outputs under `skillopt/runs/` are intentionally not tracked in git.
The installed Codex skill surface remains `SKILL.md` plus `references/`;
`skillopt/` only exists to maintain and reproduce optimization work on this
repository.
