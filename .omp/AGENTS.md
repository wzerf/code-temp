# Codebase Knowledge Graph (codebase-memory-mcp)

This project uses codebase-memory-mcp to maintain a knowledge graph of the codebase.
ALWAYS prefer MCP graph tools over grep/glob/file-search for code discovery.

## Priority Order

1. `search_graph` — find functions, classes, routes, variables by pattern
2. `trace_path` — trace who calls a function or what it calls
3. `get_code_snippet` — read specific function/class source code
4. `query_graph` — run Cypher queries for complex patterns
5. `get_architecture` — high-level project summary

## When to fall back to grep/glob

- Searching for string literals, error messages, config values
- Searching non-code files (Dockerfiles, shell scripts, configs)
- When MCP tools return insufficient results

## Examples

- Find a handler: `search_graph(name_pattern=".*OrderHandler.*")`
- Who calls it: `trace_path(function_name="OrderHandler", direction="inbound")`
- Read source: `get_code_snippet(qualified_name="pkg/orders.OrderHandler")`

# Smart Search CLI

Use the local `smart-search` command as the default execution layer for web research. This entrypoint keeps only routing, boundaries, and reference selection; load the focused reference file when command details or provider contracts matter.

## Default Workflow

1. Run `smart-search doctor --format json` when configuration or availability is uncertain.
2. If `doctor` reports missing configuration, use `smart-search setup` or `smart-search config set KEY VALUE` when the user provides keys. Do not ask users to edit global environment variables by default.
3. If OpenAI-compatible `search` hangs or times out after `doctor` succeeds, run `smart-search diagnose openai-compatible --format markdown` and use its summary.
4. If `doctor` returns `ok: true`, use only `smart-search` CLI subcommands for web research. Do not call Codex native web search in the same task.
5. Use `smart-search skills status --targets codex --format json` when the installed global skill may be stale; use `smart-search skills update --targets codex --format json` to refresh it without rerunning setup.
6. Use `smart-search smoke --mock --format json` after CLI/provider architecture changes. Use `--live` only when real keys are available and the user expects live checks.
7. Preserve command lines and source URLs in your answer. Prefer citing fetched pages or `primary_sources`; treat `extra_sources` as follow-up candidates until fetched.

## Routing

- `search`: first hop for realtime, broad exploration, community signals, multi-source summaries, and routing metadata.
- `route`: explain capability routing without executing providers.
- `research`: live Deep Research executor for end-to-end plan, discovery, fetch/read, gap check, and evidence-only synthesis.
- `deep`: offline Deep Research planner; it does not run providers, fetch pages, or replace default `search`.
- `zhipu-search`: Chinese-language, domestic China, policy/regulatory, announcements, current news, or China-local source discovery.
- `context7-library` / `context7-docs`: library, SDK, API, framework, or documentation intent. Prefer Context7 before Exa for docs/API questions.
- `exa-search`: official domains, papers, product pages, trusted pages, date/domain-filtered low-noise discovery, and adjacent source discovery through `exa-similar`.
- `fetch`: user-provided URLs or any claim that depends on page content.
- `map`: documentation site or domain structure before fetching many pages from one site.
- `anysearch-*`: explicit experimental vertical search only. Inspect domains first and do not use AnySearch as default fallback.
- `model current`: inspect explicit provider models only. Change models with `smart-search config set XAI_MODEL ...` or `smart-search config set OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL ...`.

## Key Boundaries

- `smart-search` should resolve from the user's PATH.
- Private API keys should be saved with `smart-search setup` or `smart-search config set`; environment variables remain supported for CI and advanced users.
- In sandboxed runtimes, set `SMART_SEARCH_CONFIG_DIR` to an absolute writable path when the default config directory is unavailable or must be pinned.
- The standard minimum profile requires one configured provider in each of `main_search`, `docs_search`, and fetch capability. Missing required capabilities are hard configuration failures.
- Fallback must remain same-capability only. Do not use Context7 for broad news/web facts or page-extraction providers as documentation search replacements.
- xAI Responses and OpenAI-compatible are peer `main_search` providers. Do not reuse one provider's URL/key to fabricate the other provider as fallback.
- For current-news, policy, finance, health, and other high-risk facts, do not answer from broad `search.content` alone. Fetch key pages and summarize only what fetched text supports.
- Native `web_search` is disabled in this CLI-first workflow unless the user explicitly configures another approved route; do not silently fall back to another web-search route.

# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to format, lint, type check and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation, run via `vp run <script>`.
- [ ] If setup, runtime, or package-manager behavior looks wrong, run `vp env doctor` and include its output when asking for help.

<!-- code-review-graph MCP tools -->

## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes_tool` or `query_graph_tool` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius_tool` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes_tool` + `get_review_context_tool` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph_tool` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview_tool` + `list_communities_tool`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool                             | Use when                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `detect_changes_tool`            | Reviewing code changes — gives risk-scored analysis    |
| `get_review_context_tool`        | Need source snippets for review — token-efficient      |
| `get_impact_radius_tool`         | Understanding blast radius of a change                 |
| `get_affected_flows_tool`        | Finding which execution paths are impacted             |
| `query_graph_tool`               | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes_tool`     | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword           |
| `get_architecture_overview_tool` | Understanding high-level codebase structure            |
| `refactor_tool`                  | Planning renames, finding dead code                    |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes_tool` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows_tool` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph_tool` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.

## Agent skills
